# PennSync repository consolidation

Status: **source candidate only — not approved for production deployment**.

## Canonical destination

- GitHub repository: `kdeyarmin/CareMetric-Pennsync`
- Protected preparation branch: `consolidation/pennsync-unified-2026-09-02`
- Destination baseline: `b95b567ea9487e2841e438777b12d65796c34f69`
- Feature source: `kdeyarmin/pennsync2` at `3e73ea75bd37ef2819dad952cbd5343c179bccb1`
- `kdeyarmin/pennsync` is already an ancestor of the PennSync2 feature history;
  it does not require a second code merge.

The PennSync2 feature tree was squash-integrated so its current functionality is
retained without attaching its 2,579-commit experimental history or 35,062
accidentally tracked `.pnpm-store` cache files. The original repositories and
local pre-consolidation tags preserve their histories.

## Production identity anchors

These identifiers must not be renamed or moved during source consolidation:

| Surface | Required identity |
| --- | --- |
| Base44 app | CareMetric AI, `694ec16e72e01b60d22f7cbf` |
| Permanent app origin | `https://caremetricai.base44.app/` |
| Current CareMetric custom app domain | `app.caremetricai.com` |
| Apple App Store | Apple ID `6757097720`, bundle `com.caremetric.ai` |
| Google Play | Existing package `com.caremetic.ai` (spelling is intentional) |
| PWA | Relative `id`, `start_url`, and `scope`; all four icons retained |

The installed mobile apps continue to use their existing store records. Adding
PennSync domains later must point those domains at the same CareMetric Base44
app; it must not change the permanent origin embedded in the iOS shell.

## Deliberate merge decisions

- Kept the newest Smart Note, visit preparation, medication reconciliation,
  referral upload, documentation review, OASIS safety, security, and responsive
  navigation work from PennSync2.
- Preserved CareMetric's entire `ios/` directory and full PWA manifest, then
  corrected the checked-in Xcode bundle identifier to the existing App Store
  bundle.
- Excluded `.base44/environment.json`, `.pnpm-store/`, and post-feature sandbox
  Docker configuration.
- Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with pnpm 11.9.0 and made both CI and Base44 use a
  frozen lockfile.
- Fixed the imported invitation lifecycle regression: invitations remain
  pending until a matching user is updated and approved.
- Kept the new OASIS v2 feature default OFF.

## Release blockers

Do not deploy this branch, move domains, enable OASIS v2, register new scheduled
functions, or upload a native binary until all of these are complete:

1. Create a separate nonproduction Base44 app and prove the changed entity RLS,
   functions, authentication, uploads, and shared-patient workflows there.
2. Keep `oasis_response_schema_v2_enabled` false. Complete named clinical SME
   review, patient-access enforcement, remaining consumer wiring, and hosted RLS
   proof before any agency activation.
3. Pause and redesign `computeOutcomeMeasures` before function deployment. Its
   imported implementation is platform-global, can retire existing metrics on
   its nightly run, and lacks tenant-safe KPI scoping.
4. Deliberately review `calculatePDGM`; the safer imported implementation refuses
   unverifiable legacy inputs and can return `null` estimates where production
   previously returned values.
5. Reconcile Apple/Google privacy disclosures with the clinical data actually
   handled by the app.
6. Recover and verify the original iOS and Android signing/build projects,
   in-app-purchase behavior, and store credentials before any native upload.
7. Run physical-device tests on the currently installed App Store and Play Store
   apps against the staged web release: cold launch, login, Smart Note,
   camera/microphone, uploads, downloads, telehealth, session persistence, and
   subscriptions.
8. Back up production data, document rollback, deploy frontend/functions/schema
   in a coordinated window, and smoke-test both permanent and custom origins.

Only after those gates pass should `pennsync.com` and `app.pennsync.com` be moved
from the old Base44 app to the CareMetric app. Keep the old repositories and old
Base44 app read-only until both domains and installed mobile apps have been
observed healthy through the rollback window.
