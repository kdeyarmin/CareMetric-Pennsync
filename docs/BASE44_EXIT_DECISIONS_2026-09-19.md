# Base44 exit: adopted implementation decisions

Date: 2026-09-19
Status: **proposed**. These are the assumptions the current implementation is
built on, not owner sign-off. `tools-transition-disposition.json` carries
`review_state: "proposed"` and the coverage tool reports
`owner_review_complete: false` until named owners accept them.

This record resolves the eight open choices in
[the transition plan](BASE44_TO_RAILWAY_TRANSITION_PLAN_2026-09-19.md) so work
can proceed without re-deciding them per pull request. Adopting a decision here
authorizes source changes only. It does not authorize a hosted deployment, a
migration, a release-control change, a domain move, or any spend. Every existing
gate in `REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_2026-09-02.md`,
`PENNSYNC_DATA_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK_2026-09-03.md` and
`PENNSYNC_EXTERNAL_CUTOVER_EVIDENCE.md` remains in force.

Any of these can be reversed by changing the record and the manifest; nothing
below is encoded in a way that makes reversal expensive.

## D1 — Ported business logic runs in a new Railway service

`services/pennsync-api`, Node 24, deployed from this repository with the same
Docker and no-store error posture as `services/integration-runtime`, and with
bounded request bodies and deadlines. It does not yet carry that runtime's
per-token admission pools; those exist there to protect paid provider quota,
and this service reaches no provider.

Rationale: the 282 handlers are TypeScript against the Base44 SDK, the esbuild
transpile pipeline already exists, and the team already operates Railway. Keeping
Supabase as data and authentication only avoids a second execution environment.

Consequence: authorization-critical writes stay in PostgreSQL RPCs under the
existing `pennsync_private` pattern. The service is a caller of that authority,
never a replacement for it, and holds no service-role credential for authority.

Rejected: Supabase Edge Functions (a third runtime with a different language and
deployment path) and porting handlers into the integration runtime (which would
mix paid-provider custody with ordinary business logic).

## D2 — Hybrid porting strategy

Three treatments, assigned per capability in the manifest:

- **port** — a reviewed, contract-per-capability transfer. Required for anything
  that reads or writes patient data, referrals, visits, documents, memberships
  or notifications.
- **broker** — one reviewed tenant-scoped RPC family for low-risk configuration
  and reference tables, authorized from the membership row rather than a
  bespoke contract each.
- **retire / hub / preserved_paused** — not ported here at all.

Rationale: a strict per-function transfer of all 282 handlers does not finish at
any realistic pace, and a generic entity proxy is forbidden by the existing
membrane design. A reviewed broker for non-PHI configuration is neither.

Consequence: `broker` is a ceiling on risk, not a shortcut. A capability may
only hold that disposition while it touches no PHI and no authority decision.

## D3 — Two-step cutover

Step one is `business_backend_exit`: authentication, data, files and business
execution become independent while Base44 continues to serve the static shell
and the custom domain. Step two is `complete_hosting_exit`, after a new native
build is approved and shipped.

Rationale: the iOS wrapper hard-binds `https://caremetricai.base44.app/` and
declares `base44.app` / `base44.com` as App-Bound Domains. Removing that origin
before a new signed build reaches devices breaks every installed app.

Consequence: the cutover evidence packet is assembled twice, once per mode. The
retained-shell and hosting-dependency flags must be true in step one.

## D4 — A dedicated production Supabase project

A new project in the production region. `caremetric-pennsync-staging`
(`xxtyweswohkvgkprimwa`) stays staging. `CM Train` (`xsqobvvreaovwibxwyvv`)
keeps only the integration runtime's own state and private bucket.

Rationale: `CM Train` carries the Support Hub's authentication tenant and its
provisioning triggers, which `services/authority-store/README.md` records as
needing a separate access-boundary review. Sharing it would entangle two
products' identity boundaries.

Consequence: provisioning it needs explicit cost approval, as the staging
project did on 2026-09-18. Until then no production-shaped schema exists.

## D5 — Both source apps migrate into one store with distinct namespaces

CareMetric production (`694ec16e72e01b60d22f7cbf`) and legacy PennSync
(`68ee80d98929370f9e8f2932`) are carried into the same target, keyed by
`(source_app_id, entity, id)` as the archive format already requires.

Rationale: the 2026-09-03 inventory found zero overlapping User or Patient IDs,
so the two apps are separate identity systems that cannot be merged by
coincidence of key. Preserving the namespace keeps every legacy row traceable.

Consequence: ambiguous ownership is quarantined, never guessed. The log tables
(`UserActivity`, `SystemLog`, `SecurityLog`, `AuditTrail`, `AppliedDataLog`,
`ArchivedRecord`) are deliberately left `undecided` in the manifest because the
runbook requires a separate retention decision for them.

## D6 — Identity migrates by re-enrollment, never by credential copy

Users are enrolled through Supabase Auth invitations against an
operator-verified identity map. No password hash, session, refresh token or MFA
seed is exported or recreated.

Rationale: Base44 exposes no supported credential export, and the archive format
already refuses credential-shaped material outright. The affected population is
ten accounts across both apps.

Consequence: cutover requires a communicated re-enrollment window. Base44
platform identity handlers (`onUserSignup`, `adminResetPassword`,
`resetUserPassword`, `createUserWithTempPassword`, and its V2) are `retire`,
because Supabase Auth owns those operations in the target.

## D7 — Paused domains are carried as `preserved_paused`

Fax, SMS, voice, telehealth, e-signature, messaging, OASIS v2, PDGM payment,
outcome computation, patient merge and public provider follow-up keep their
current paused state through the cutover and are ported only after their own
gate passes.

Rationale: the cutover contract admits an already-paused capability only with
receipts attesting both the baseline pause and the preserved pause. Disabling a
working feature is not preservation, and releasing one during a migration would
mean proving two changes at once.

Consequence: 102 handlers and 51 entity schemas are carried without being
activated. Their schemas and data still migrate; only their execution stays off.
Eight of those handlers are counted here only because the evidence check below
reclassified them: seven were wrongly `port` or `broker`, and one was
`undecided`. All eight are fail-closed pauses, not live work.

## D8 — Learning moves to the Support Hub rather than being ported

The 44 learning, training and central-adapter handlers and their 28 entity
schemas are `hub`, per `CENTRAL_LEARNING_CUTOVER.md`.

Rationale: that direction is already recorded and already has a deployed Hub
runtime. Porting them into `pennsync-api` would build a second home for
content that is leaving.

Consequence: the Hub cutover becomes a prerequisite of the exit rather than a
parallel project, and `HEYGEN_API_KEY` retires with it. Learner history,
certificates and credits must be preserved by that cutover, not by this one.

## How these decisions are enforced

`tools-transition-disposition.json` assigns one disposition to every function,
entity schema, workflow and Core integration. `pnpm run check:transition-disposition`
and its test fail when a capability is added without a disposition, or when a
manifest entry survives a capability that no longer exists.

A disposition is also checked against the source it describes. `port`, `broker`
and `hub` each assert that a capability still has behavior worth carrying, so
none of them may be given to a function whose module cannot do anything: one
that imports nothing, awaits nothing, reaches no network or environment and
constructs no Base44 client serves the same constant response to every caller.
That is the shape this repository uses to hold a quarantined, paused or retired
endpoint fail closed, and 30 of the 282 functions have it today. Such a function
can only be carried `preserved_paused` or retired; claiming otherwise would send
a reviewer to port an endpoint with nothing left in it. The check reads the
module rather than the wording of its comment or the status code it serves, so a
constant `200` that skips its own work is treated the same as a constant `503`.

Eight entries asserted exactly that before the check existed, and all eight are
now corrected:

| Function | Was | Is | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `analyzeClinicalData` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending a tenant-authorized broker |
| `analyzeDocument` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending a private write broker |
| `analyzeNursePerformance` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending immutable tenant provenance |
| `autoAssignNurseToPatient` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Assignment trigger disabled pending an audited workflow |
| `generateDischargeSummary` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending a tenant-owned sink |
| `generatePatientEducation` | `port` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending a tenant-owned sink |
| `getPatientContext` | `port` | `retire` | Answers `410`; superseded by purpose-bound read brokers |
| `runSecurityAudit` | `broker` | `preserved_paused` | Fail-closed pending immutable tenant provenance |

`getUserActivityLog` was `undecided` and is a pause of the same kind, so the
evidence resolves it to `preserved_paused` as well. The `UserActivity` entity
behind it stays `undecided`: whether that history is carried at all remains a
decision for its owners, and the endpoint being paused does not make it.

Current coverage, measured on this branch:

| Family | Capabilities | Classified |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Backend functions | 282 | 282 |
| Entity schemas | 253 | 253 |
| Native workflows | 7 | 7 |
| Core integrations | 7 | 7 |

Thirty-one entries are `undecided` and are reported as blocking. They are not an
oversight: each is a capability whose target home depends on a decision this
record deliberately does not make. They are the unmigrated `Notification`
producers, the reusable-content roots whose legacy tenant ownership is
unestablished, the log tables, the generic workflow-engine rows, in-app
integration secret custody, and store subscription entitlements.

`census_ready` stays false until every one of them is resolved and an owner
moves `review_state` to `accepted`. Until then the dispositions above are the
working assumption of the implementation, and nothing more.
